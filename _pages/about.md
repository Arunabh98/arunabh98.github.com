Hello, This is Arunabh Ghosh, a First Year Electrical Engineering Student at IIT Bombay. 

I love learning new ideas and concepts especially in fields related to programming algorithms, machine learning, and intelligent robotics. Solving problems in Mathematics, Programming and Physics is my passion and would not give up until I find at least one solution to the problem.

My hobbies include listening to music, travelling to new places and following up on the technical events from around the world.
