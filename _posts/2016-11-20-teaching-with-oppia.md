It's been a long time since my last post and a lot of things have happened since then. But if there is one thing worth writing a blog about it is this - _Stumbling across Oppia_. It was around mid-August, I was browsing some of the projects on Github, I came across the [Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) project.

For those of you haven't heard about Oppia, here's a brief description...

What is Oppia?
--------------
The mission of the Oppia project is simple - _To help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way._

The site aims to teach students through the unique concept of an exploration. We don't teach students, instead the students themselves explore the concept they want to learn. With Oppia, we can create explorations that help students learn in a fun and creative way, using videos, images, and open-ended questions.

This simple vision which was started in 2012 has since turned into an educational platform with over 5,500 explorations that are used by approximately 145,000 users worldwide. Have a look at the site yourselves - [https://www.oppia.org/library](https://www.oppia.org/library) - isn't it wonderful!
