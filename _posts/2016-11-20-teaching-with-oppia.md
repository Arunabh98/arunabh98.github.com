It's been a long time since my last post and a lot of things have happened since then. But if there is one thing worth writing a blog about it is this - _Stumbling across Oppia_. It was around mid-August, I was browsing some of the projects on Github, I came across the [Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) project.

For those of you haven't heard about Oppia, here's a brief description...

What is Oppia?
--------------
The mission of the Oppia project is simple - _To help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way._

The site aims to teach students through the unique concept of an exploration. We don't teach students, instead the students themselves explore the concept they want to learn. With Oppia, we can create explorations that help students learn in a fun and creative way, using videos, images, and open-ended questions.

This simple vision which was started in 2012 has since turned into an educational platform with over 5,500 explorations that are used by approximately 145,000 users worldwide. Have a look at the site yourselves - [https://www.oppia.org/library](https://www.oppia.org/library) - isn't it wonderful!

My involvement with Oppia!
--------------------------
I was naturally intrigued by this idea. I filled up the Oppia Contributor Survey which asked me about my interests, which subjects I am passionate about. Soon I got a mail from Sean Lip (Founder of Oppia) advising me to work on a collection of explorations that would help students understand the topic of electromagnetism.

But why electromagnetism? I believe the reasons mentioned by Sean were spot on. Electromagnetism isn't an intuitive topics for students to understand. If anyone tries to self learn this topic it would be very difficult for him/her. The information on this topic is scattered across the internet with no site offering a cohesive experience for students to feel comfortable with the topic. So if we could create a learning experience that made the topic more accessible, that would be a great thing to try and would be really helpful for many students.

So we first decided to come up with a plan. If we want to craft a nice learning experience for the learner it helps to have a concrete plan of action before we start creating the individual explorations. Otherwise if we just jump in and start writing them, we might end up writing into a dead end. Having a condensed outline also helps to ensure that there's a coherent story throughout.

So I created a document outlining the details of the explorations. I decided to teach students up till Gauss' law for now. I divided the topics into 3 explorations - the first exploration to introduce the students to the world of electricity, teach them the basic laws of electrostatistics, the second exploration to introduce the students to the important concept of electric field and the last one to introduce them to Gauss' Law.

I really want students to enjoy, while they go through the explorations. Now who can I take inspiration from? Which Nobel Prize winning physicist has been regarded as one of best teachers of physics? It's none other than Richard Feynman! So the first reference I picked up to help me through this was the second volume of _'The Feynman Lectures on Physics'_ - The one on electromagnetism and matter. I also went through other references such as _'Concepts of Physics'_ by H.C. Verma and '_Fundamentals of Physics_' by Resnick & Halliday to help me explain some tricky parts. 

After creating the document comes the most important part - review, the part that diffrentiates great explorations from good explorations. Without Sean's guidians and ideas the explorations would not have turned out as good as they are. Sean's insistence on explaining each and everything intuitively gives a uniques flavour to the explorations. They were quite a few cases where I felt the explanations should be obvious to the learner (curse of knowledge, maybe?) but Sean was kind enough to point those out, thus improving the quality of the explorations far more than expected.

Here is the final design document that Sean and I created - [Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pV_jdLKR1LFnFRuXmZGE-5I4bhpx9fnZZIRcHf7QUmY/edit?usp=sharing).
